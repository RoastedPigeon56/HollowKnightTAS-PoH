Movie Length: 61151 frames (16 min 59.183 sec)

# Notes

## Possible opmizations: 

* better RNG (eg. Gorb, Oblobbles, Pure Vessel)
* better strats (eg. Hornet 1)
* better movement details (eg. False Knight)

## Others

* Due to the Steel Soul save file, the in-game Real Time didn't show up at the end of the movie and credits from Team Cherry showed up instead so I discarded this part.
* For some reasons some of the Nail Arts didn't cause proper damages (eg. Nightmare King), which were not noticeable before a boss was finished since I was TASing the vanilla game.

# Credit
